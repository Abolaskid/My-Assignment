<h2>1.0 INTRODUCTION TO HTML</h2>
<p>The aim of this course is to get you started designing web pages. It is assumed that you have little or no experience of the subject. During our time together, you'll learn some new concepts and ideas, most of which will not be difficult. After all, there are billions of pages on the internet, designed by the whole spectrum of humanity: children, adults, pensioners, people from all walks of life have sites out there. And if they can do it, so can you. In fact, follow the lessons carefully and you WILL do it. Before long, you'll have your own pages designed and ready to be uploaded, there for all the world to see.</p>
<p>At the heart of every web page is something called HTML. You will learn what this is, and how to code it. </p>
<h3>WHAT IS HTML</h3>
<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.</li>
    <li>As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.</li>
</ul>
<p>Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.
     Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language.</p>
     <p>To learn HTML, you will need to study various tags and understand how they behave, while formatting a textual document. Learning HTML is simple as users have to learn the usage of different tags in order to format the text or images to make a beautiful webpage.</p><br>
<p>Files on your computer come with extensions. Web pages have their own file extensions. Oddly there are two different extensions, a three letter file extension and a four letter extension. Web pages come with the extension .htm or .html. A browser can recognise either extension.</p>
<p>When you open up a web page with your browser, Internet Explorer for example, the browser software checks the file extension, the same check that Word and Excel make. If it sees the .htm or .html extension it knows it's a web page and then tries to open it. (Modern browsers, though, can open up other types of files. Internet Explorer can open up your Word documents and PDF files.) Most web pages on the internet are written in code called HTML. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and is fairly easy to get the hang of. That's because HTML is not a programming language: it is a language designed to improve the presentation of text. For example, in Microsoft Word, if you want a nice big heading, you can select a font size from a menu. HTML has an easy way to change the size of text of headings, too, which you'll see in a moment. But that's basically all you are doing with HTML ' presenting text and images on a page. The way you do this is with things called TAGS.</p>


     <h3>Software for Writing Web Pages</h3>
<p>To start writing web pages, we'll use a simple text editor. </p>
<p>If you use Windows, then Notepad, NotePad++, Viusal Studio Code are an excellent text editor to use.  But i prefer Visual Studio Code because of it usefulness.</p>
<p>The software should look like this, when it launches:</p>

<p>Mac and Linux users have a number of text editors available, but finding a free one that is as good as Notepad++ is quite difficult. Bluefish is OK, but looks a bit dated, especially for HTML. For a basic text editor like Notepad, Macs come with TextEdit, which you can find in your Applications folder. You might want to play around with the Preferences, though, or you'll end up with Rich Text rather than Plain Text. Another good free editor for the Mac is TextWrangler.</p>
